# Machine Learning in Real World Problem Solving
## Objective:
The objective of this repository is to write proof of concept code for solving Real world problems using AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and data science by using advance mathematical models to provide predictive modeling for solving the problems.

## Real World Problem Discussed
Let's tackle the problem of Money Laundering. Its a very big problem in the real world. Big Corporations and Institute are investing millions of dollars to prevent it. Let's see if we can us approach based on machine learn to help us write tools that can work as Anti-Money Laundering Software. 

## Concepts Used:
Data is the lifeblood of financial institutions and other organizations. It is used to run processes, manage financials, predict risk, prove compliance, target customers and influence decisions. In anti-money laundering (AML) and compliance, the data required to identify and combat financial crime is complex. It is also difficult to gather because data is often stored across a patchwork of legacy systems, new systems and siloed business-specific applications. Data quality can vary greatly. Working with unreliable, incomplete or inconsistent data makes it difficult to identify bad actors who pose a financial and reputational threat, which undermines an institutionâ€™s ability to efficiently manage risk across the enterprise.
The more complex and geographically diverse a financial institution is, the greater the threat. Institutions with very large customer databases and transaction volumes that span numerous distribution channels and counterparties face the greatest number of challenges and the most risk.
